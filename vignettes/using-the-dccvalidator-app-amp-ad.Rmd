# Introduction

We've built the dccvalidator tool to streamline the process of data validation
and QA/QC. As the AMP-AD Knowledge Portal has grown to 50+ studies and over
70,000 data files, we've realized a need to be more standardized in our
approaches to data curation. Thus, we built an application that performs many of
the routine data quality checks we previously conducted by hand, with the hopes
that it will help you, the data contributor, get your data checked, validated,
and shared more easily and quickly.

The application can be found at https://shinypro.synapse.org/users/kwoo/dccvalidator-app/

To use this application you must:

1. Be logged in to Synapse in your browser
2. Be a [Synapse certified user](https://docs.synapse.org/articles/accounts_certified_users_and_profile_validation.html)
3. Be a member of the AMP-AD consortium team

Some portions of the app submit data to Synapse. This allows curators at Sage to
troubleshoot issues if needed; no one outside the Sage curation team will be
able to download the data.

# Instructions

## Step 1: Contact the AMP-AD data coordinating administrator

Please contact the AMP-AD data coordinating administrator
(<AMPAD_SageAdmin@synapse.org>) to let us know that you plan to submit data.

AMP-AD organizes data into studies, which are based on cohorts or model systems.
If you are contributing data for a new study, we will work with you to name the
study and provide you with a location to which you will upload data. If you are
contributing new data for an existing study, we will provide you with the
location to which you will upload data. If you're not sure whether your data
should be a new study or part of an existing one, we can help you figure that
out.

## Step 2: Provide documentation of the study

Each study in AMP-AD has accompanying [documentation in the portal](https://adknowledgeportal.synapse.org/#/Explore/Studies?Study=syn8391648). 
If you are submitting a new study, or a new assay for an existing study, you
will need to provide documentation of the methods you used. If you are
submitting new data for an existing assay in an existing study (such as RNAseq
data for new samples in a study that already contains RNAseq data), you can skip
this step.

You can submit your documentation through the dccvalidator app on the
Documentation page. There should be a study description for the whole study, and
an assay description for each of the assays that was performed. These can be in
a single file, or you can upload multiple files to the assay description
section.

## Step 3: Prepare metadata

Each study should include metadata that would help a new researcher understand
and reuse the data. In most cases, we will expect 4 files:

1. **Individual metadata** describing each individual in the study
2. **Biospecimen metadata** describing the specimens that were collected
3. **Assay metadata** describing the assay that was performed. If multiple
   assays were part of the study, there will be one assay file for each.
4. A **manifest** listing each file that will be uploaded (including raw data
   files as well as the metadata files above), where it will be uploaded to, and
   some additional metadata about the files. The `parent` column of the manifest
   should contain the synapse ID that we provided you in Step 1.

We provide templates for all of the metadata files and the manifest within the
portal: https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn18512044

If you don't see a template for the assay(s) in your study, please get in touch.

## Step 4: Validate metadata

The data validation portion of the app allows you to upload metadata files (as
.csv) and the manifest (as .tsv or .txt) and view the results of a series of
automated checks.

Examples of the types of checks we perform are:

- All required columns from the templates are present 
- Individuals and specimens have unique identifiers
- Metadata terms conform to a controlled vocabulary where applicable

### Viewing data summary

We also provide a summary of the files you have uploaded, showing the number of
individuals, specimens, and files. We visualize the data in each column by its
data type to help spot unexpected missing values.

## Step 5: Upload data to Synapse

Once you have submitted your documentation, validated your metadata, and
corrected any errors found by the validator, you are ready to submit data to
Synapse. Use the [R](https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/synapserutils#batch-process), [Python, or command line](https://python-docs.synapse.org/build/html/synapseutils.html#synapseutils.sync.syncToSynapse) clients to upload, or contact the DCC team for assistance.
