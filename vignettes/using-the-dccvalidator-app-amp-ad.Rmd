# Introduction

The dccvalidator tool streamlines the data curation process by performing
metadata validation checks before data is uploaded. It also allows contributors
to submit documentation of their studies, making the data more understandable
and discoverable. The dccvalidator application can be found at
https://shinypro.synapse.org/users/kwoo/dccvalidator-app/.

To use this application you must:

1. Be logged in to Synapse in your browser
2. Be a [Synapse certified user](https://docs.synapse.org/articles/accounts_certified_users_and_profile_validation.html)
3. Be a member of the AMP-AD consortium team

Some portions of the app submit data to Synapse. This allows curators at Sage to
troubleshoot issues if needed; no one outside the Sage curation team will be
able to download the data.

# Instructions

## Step 1: Contact the AMP-AD data coordinating administrator

Please contact the AMP-AD data coordinating
administrator(<AMPAD_SageAdmin@synapse.org>) to let us know that you plan to
submit data. The AMP-AD Knowledge Portal organizes data into studies, which are
sets of data and metadata from a specific human cohort, model system, or other
experimental unit. If you are contributing data for a new study, we will work
with you to name the study and provide you with a location to which you will
upload data. If you are contributing new data for an existing study, we will
provide you with the location to which you will upload data. If you're not sure
whether your data should be a new study or part of an existing one, we can help
you figure that out.

## Step 2: Provide documentation of the study

Each study has accompanying [documentation in the
portal](https://adknowledgeportal.synapse.org/#/Explore/Studies?Study=syn8391648).
If you are submitting a new study, or data for a new assay within an existing
study, you will need to provide documentation about the study and of the methods
you used. If you are submitting new data for an existing assay in an existing
study (such as RNAseq data on additional donors), you can skip this step.

You can submit your study and assay documentation through the dccvalidator app
on the Documentation page. There must be a study description, and a description
of each of the assays that were performed. These can be in a single file, or you
can upload multiple files to the assay description section. 
![A screenshot of a website with instructions on how to provide documentation of a study, and a space to upload documentation files](../man/figures/amp-documentation.png).

If you are submitting documentation for multiple studies, it should be submitted
one study at a time. To acknowledge your data contribution you can upload an
acknowledgement statement, and/or publication that should be referenced in
publications based on secondary data use, in the study description file.


## Step 3: Prepare metadata

Each study must include metadata that helps data users understand and reuse the
data. In most cases, we will expect 4 files:

1. **Individual metadata** describing each individual in the study
2. **Biospecimen metadata** describing the specimens that were collected
3. **Assay metadata** describing the assay that was performed. If multiple
   assays were part of the study, there will be one assay file for each.
4. A **manifest** listing each file that will be uploaded (including raw data
   files as well as the metadata files above), where it will be uploaded to, and
   some additional metadata about the files. The `parent` column of the manifest
   should contain the synapse ID that we provided you in Step 1.

We provide templates for all of the metadata files and the manifest within the
portal: https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn18512044

If you don't see a template for the assay(s) in your study, please get in touch.

### Adding to an existing study

If you are adding new data to an existing study, please create and validate a
complete set of metadata. For example, if you are adding data on new donors, you
should download the existing individual metadata file and add the new donors as
additional rows, rather than submitting a file containing only the new donors.
If you need help finding the existing metadata, please contact the AMP-AD data
coordinating administrator.

## Step 4: Validate metadata

The data validation portion of the app allows you to upload metadata files (as.csv) and the manifest (as .tsv or .txt) and view the results of a series of automated checks. 

Examples of the types of checks we perform are: 

- All required columns from the templates are present 
- Individuals and specimens have unique identifiers
- Metadata terms conform to a controlled vocabulary where applicable

### Viewing data summary
 
We provide a summary of the files you have uploaded, showing the number of
individuals, specimens, and files. We visualize the data in each column by its
data type to help spot unexpected missing values.

## Step 5: Contact the AMP-AD data coordinating administrator and upload data

Once you have submitted your documentation, validated your metadata, and
corrected any errors found by the validator, you are ready to submit data to
Synapse. Contact the AMP-AD data coordinating administrator, who will grant you
edit permissions to the Synapse folder.

Use the [R](https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/synapserutils#batch-process), [Python, or command line](https://python-docs.synapse.org/build/html/synapseutils.html#synapseutils.sync.syncToSynapse) clients to upload the files in your manifest. The DCC team can help if you need assistance.
