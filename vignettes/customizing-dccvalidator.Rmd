dccvalidator is intended to be customizable for different settings. The Shiny
application uses a [configuration file](https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/dccvalidator/blob/master/config.yml)
to set details such as where to store uploaded files, which metadata templates
to validate against, whom to contact with questions, etc.

To create a custom version of the app, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Create a Synapse project or folder with the appropriate permissions to store
   uploaded files. In AMP-AD, we created a folder to which consortium members
   have permissions to read and write, but *not* download. Only the curation
   team has the ability to download files (in order to assist with debugging).
   See this
   [example of how to create a project with appropriate permissions](https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/dccvalidator/blob/master/inst/app/create_project.R).
1. Fork the [dccvalidator](https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/dccvalidator/blob/master/config.yml)
   GitHub repository.
1. Create a new configuration in the `config.yml` file. Note that any values you
   do not customize will be inherited from the default configuration.
1. (Optional): create a pull request with your configuration back to the
   upstream dccvalidator repository.
1. Within the file [`app.R`](https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/dccvalidator/blob/master/app.R),
   replace the `"default"` configuration with the name of your new 
   configuration.
1. Deploy the application as described in the 
   [Deploying dccvalidator](https://sage-bionetworks.github.io/dccvalidator/articles/deploying-dccvalidator.html) 
   vignette.

Alternatively, instead of forking the repository you can install dccvalidator
and create an `app.R` file containing the following:

```
library("dccvalidator")
run_app()
```

The other steps above (creating a folder to store files, and providing a
configuration file with a default configuration) are still necessary.

## Configuration options

* `parent`: The Synapse project or folder where files will be stored
* `study_table`: Synapse ID of a table that lists all of the existing studies in
  the consortium. It should have a column called `StudyName`.
* `annotations_table`: Synapse ID of a table that lists allowable annotation
  keys and values for the consortium. This should follow the same basic format
  as our Synapse Annotations table, e.g. there must be the following columns:
  `key`, `value`, and `columnType`. `columnType` options are `STRING`,
  `BOOLEAN`, `INTEGER`, `DOUBLE`.
* `annotations_link`: URL to a list or description of allowable annotation
  values (so users can read more)
* `templates_link`: URL to the location of metadata templates
* `study_link_animal`: URL to an example study description for an animal model
  study
* `study_link_human`: URL to an example study description for a human study
* `teams`: The team(s) a user must be a member of in order to use the app. If
  the user is not in any of the teams, they will see a message telling them they
  must be added to one of the teams.
* `templates` (including `manifest_template`, `individual_templates`,
  `biospecimen_templates`, and `assay_templates`): Synapse IDs of templates to
  use for validation. These should be either .xlsx or .csv files, where the
  column names reflect the required columns in the template. If the template is
  an excel file with multiple sheets, the first sheet will be used.
* `species_list`: List of possible species in the consortium. These are shown as
  options in the validation UI and control which individual template and
  biospecimen template the app validates against.
* `complete_columns`: For each metadata file and the manifest, a list of the
  columns that must be complete (i.e. not contain any missing values or empty
  strings)
* `contact_email`: Email address linked in footer for users to contact if they
  have questions
