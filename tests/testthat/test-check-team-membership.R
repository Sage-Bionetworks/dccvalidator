## TODO: test the behavior when a user *is* in the team. This requires a shiny
## session in which to show the dialog. It'll be something to address as part of
## https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/dccvalidator/issues/56 -- how to test the
## app itself. We may want to make some mini apps with some of these components
## for testing.
